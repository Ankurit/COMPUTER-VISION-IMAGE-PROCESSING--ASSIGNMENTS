# COMPUTER-VISION-IMAGE-PROCESSING--ASSIGNMENTS
Take a color image/photo/picture:
i.	Convert color image to gray image (without using inbuilt function) and display them both using subplot.
ii.	Convert the result of (i) into binary image (without using inbuilt function) and display all three images (Color, Gray, Binary) using subplot.
Working with Color images: Create a pure Red Rectangle image using any software (MS Word/MS PPT/ MS paint/Adobe Photoshop/â€¦). Note that pure red, we mean, when we open the image with our Python/MATLAB, we should see all the pixel values in Red channel as 255. 
i.	Change the given pure Red rectangle image to pure Blue rectangle and display both the original and processed image using subplot.
ii.	Change the given pure Red rectangle image to pure Yellow, Cyan and Magenta and rectangle and display all the four images (Original and the three processed images) using subplot.
